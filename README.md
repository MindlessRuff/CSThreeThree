# Initial readme

This is subject to change and very open to suggestions. My idea is to have two teams vs each other on a small 2D isometric map.
You control the player team, and generate income, buy items and upgrades for your team as you progress.
At first I was thinking of you heeho being a Counter Strike pro.
CTs and terrorists fighting to plant/defuse the bomb but it can go anywhere depending on the theme of the jam really.
